# How to sustain a treatment directory?

## Define the user and the problem

People in need and social workers, nurses, etc. that can help them. Sometimes the people in need don't have the access themselves to get the things they need, so social workers and nurses are good targets because they'll have access to computer, Internet, etc. and can use that information to help others.

Has to be quick because most nurses don't have the time. They get paid for the time they spend with the client, they won't get paid for spending time at home working with a web site.

## What are pain points with the status quo?

A nurse might recognize a need and contact a social worker.

## Solution ideas

## Notes from a social worker

Lady needed food stamps but couldn't leave her home. Social worker asked on her behalf, can I get her a form so I can get food stamps for her? Oh yeah, just call this number. Solution already there, just the person in need didn't know about it.

A man trying to get money from Veterans Affairs couldn't understand the papers he was getting in the mail, telling him to submit documentation. Social worker acted as middleman to interpret papers, fax some forms on the man's behalf. Man got his money and other things he needed. Organization willing to give the man what he needed, there was just a communication barrier preventing him from getting it.

Elderly person didn't know they needed a landline to be able to use a LifeAlert button. Also didn't know they could get a landline for free. Not just a phone but hot meals, help around the house, could be anything they need and don't realize they can get. AT&T gives landlines for free to elderly people if you meet criteria, like if you're on food stamps.
