## Notes from a social worker

Lady needed foodstamps but couldn't leave her home. Social worker asked on her behalf, can I get her a form so I can get foodstamps for her? Oh yeah, just call this number. Solution already there, just the person in need didn't know about it.

A man trying to get money from Veterans Affairs couldn't understand the papers he was getting in the mail, telling him to submit documentation. Social worker acted as middleman to interpret papers, fax some forms on the man's behalf. Man got his money and other things he needed. Organization willing to give the man what he needed, there was just a communication barrier preventing him from getting it.
