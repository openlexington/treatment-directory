# How to sustain a treatment directory?

## Define the user and the problem

People in need (clients) and social workers, nurses, etc. that can help them. Sometimes the people in need don't have the access themselves to get the things they need, so social workers and nurses are good targets because they'll have access to computer, Internet, etc. and can use that information to help others.

Has to be quick because most nurses don't have the time. They get paid for the time they spend with the client, they won't get paid for spending time at home working with a web site.

A nurse might recognize a need and contact a social worker. Clients might contact a relative for help, others don't have that resource. So people just don't get help. Nurses are overworked.

How do you convince a nurse or someone to use a tool that would still require time investment that they might not get paid for? Desire to help their patients.

Nurses and social workers have eyes for different things, they see different problems. What's your blood pressure versus when was the last time someone cleaned.

## What are pain points with the status quo?

Information is there but people who need it 1) don't know it exists, 2) can't get to it, 3) can't understand the paperwork or other things blocking them from getting what they need.

Resources exist but get out of date. Out in the wild with a client is the most difficult time to find information. Even when you're in the office, sometimes the information is out of date.

Sometimes there's not a social worker for a client to talk to. 

[Aunt Bertha](https://www.auntbertha.com/get_directory?postal=42701#program-details-ahJzfnNlYXJjaGJlcnRoYS1ocmRyFAsSB1Byb2dyYW0YgICAspymqQoM) was one attempt for this. Some information does not seem relevant for the zip code that's searched. There's a free service but it's not as good as the paid one, and the paid one would be expensive. Also info is not prominent about age restrictions for services provided, like if the service is just for children versus adults.

## Solution ideas

- TurboTax-style questions for a client. How are you feeling, etc., and the information could go back into the system, to the nurse, the social worker, etc.
    - Nurses could incorporate questions into the discharge step.
- A mobile app to be used by health care professionals would be the most helpful, says social worker.
- HIPAA compliance is a concern.
- Knowledge-sharing tool for caregivers.

## Notes from a social worker

Lady needed food stamps but couldn't leave her home. Social worker asked on her behalf, can I get her a form so I can get food stamps for her? Oh yeah, just call this number. Solution already there, just the person in need didn't know about it.

A man trying to get money from Veterans Affairs couldn't understand the papers he was getting in the mail, telling him to submit documentation. Social worker acted as middleman to interpret papers, fax some forms on the man's behalf. Man got his money and other things he needed. Organization willing to give the man what he needed, there was just a communication barrier preventing him from getting it.

Elderly person didn't know they needed a landline to be able to use a LifeAlert button. Also didn't know they could get a landline for free. Not just a phone but hot meals, help around the house, could be anything they need and don't realize they can get. AT&T gives landlines for free to elderly people if you meet criteria, like if you're on food stamps.

Social worker ends up doing a lot of work she wouldn't get paid for because she wanted to do it and knew if she didn't do it, it wouldn't get done.

[Department of Aging and Independent Living](http://chfs.ky.gov/dail/) would be the people who would enter resource information initially. Different development districts have their own resource directories. [Bluegrass Area Development District](http://bgadd.org/)

What makes a good development district? They call you back. They sound excited to talk to you on the phone. They keep their information up to date. They're thorough. They have a mobile app.

Accessibility to programs via mobile would help the clients the most, says social worker. A lot of areas don't have good cell coverage, so it'd be on the social worker to look something up at the office and call the client back.

The age range that is served is very important information. Some programs are only for children, some programs are for veterans. Also distinguishing between paid and free services.

Food stamps, WIC, Medicare, Medicaid, substance abuse--big categories our social worker interviewee would look for on a resource directory. Housekeeping, bathing, at home with no food. Need detail and subcategories. Home health needs for elderly clients.

What would a sponsor want to see in a service like this? Meetings. If I'm going to visit my parents in Richmond and my sponsor is in Louisville, if I'm having issues the first thing the sponsor will say is 'find a meeting.'
